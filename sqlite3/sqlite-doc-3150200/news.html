SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_15_2.html">version 3.15.2</a> is a bug-fix patch release that fixes several minor
issues in the 3.15.0 and 3.15.1 releases.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2016_11_04"></a><h3>2016-11-04 - Release 3.15.1</h3><blockquote>
SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_15_1.html">version 3.15.1</a> is a bug-fix patch release that fixes some minor
issues in the 3.15.0 release.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2016_10_14"></a><h3>2016-10-14 - Release 3.15.0</h3><blockquote>
SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_15_0.html">version 3.15.0</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
The key feature in this release is the added support for
<a href="rowvalue.html">row values</a>.  There are also other enhancements and
fixes for a number of obscure bugs.
<p>
The 3.15.0 release uses about 7% fewer CPU cycles than 3.14.2.
Most of the improvement in this release
is in the SQL parser, query planner, and
byte-code generator (the front-end) corresponding
to the <a href="c3ref/prepare.html">sqlite3_prepare_v2()</a> interface.  Overall,
version 3.15.0 uses about half as much CPU time as
version 3.8.1 (2013-10-17).  These
performance measurements are made using the "speedtest1.c"
workload on x64 compiled with gcc and -Os. Performance
improvements may vary with different platforms and
workloads.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2016_09_12"></a><h3>2016-09-12 - Release 3.14.2</h3><blockquote>
SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_14_2.html">version 3.14.2</a> fixes several obscure bugs and adds 
improved support for building SQLite using the STDCALL calling
convention on 32-bit windows systems.  Upgrading from versions
3.14 and 3.14.1 is optional.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2016_08_11"></a><h3>2016-08-11 - Release 3.14.1</h3><blockquote>
SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_14_1.html">version 3.14.1</a> adds a small patch to improve the performance
of the pcache1TruncateUnsafe() routine for cases when the only a few
pages on the end of the cache are being removed.  This causes COMMITs
to run faster when there is a very large page cache.  Upgrading from
version 3.14 is optional.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2016_08_08"></a><h3>2016-08-08 - Release 3.14</h3><blockquote>
SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_14.html">version 3.14</a> (the "&#960;" release)
is a regularly scheduled maintenance
release containing performance enhancements, new features, and fixes for
obscure bugs.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2016_05_18"></a><h3>2016-05-18 - Release 3.13.0</h3><blockquote>
SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_13_0.html">version 3.13.0</a> is a regularly schedule maintenance release containing
performance enhancements and fixes for obscure bugs.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2016_04_18"></a><h3>2016-04-18 - Release 3.12.2</h3><blockquote>
<p>Yikes!  The 3.12.0 and 3.12.1 releases contain a backwards compatibility bug!
   Tables that declare a column with type <tt>"INTEGER" PRIMARY KEY</tt>
   (where the datatype name INTEGER is quoted) generate an incompatible
   database file.  The mistake came about because the developers have never
   thought to put a typename in quotes before, and so there was no documentation 
   of that capability nor any tests.  (There are tests now, though, of course.)
   Instances of quoting the datatype name are probably infrequent in the wild,
   so we do not expect the impact of this bug to be too severe.
   Upgrading is still strongly recommended.
<p>Fixes for three other minor issues were included in this patch release.
   The other issues would have normally been deferred until the next scheduled
   release, but since a patch release is being issued anyhow, they might as
   well be included.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2016_04_08"></a><h3>2016-04-08 - Release 3.12.1</h3><blockquote>
<p>SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_12_1.html">version 3.12.1</a> is an emergency patch release to address a 
   <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/7f7f8026eda38">crash bug</a> that snuck
   into <a href="releaselog/3_12_0.html">version 3.12.0</a>.  Upgrading from version 3.12.0 is highly
   recommended.
<p>Another minor problem involving datatypes on <a href="lang_createview.html">view</a> columns, and
   a query planner deficiency are fixed at the same time.  These two
   issues did not justify a new release on their own, but since a release
   is being issued to deal with the crash bug, we included these other
   fixes for good measure.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2016_03_29"></a><h3>2016-03-29 - Release 3.12.0</h3><blockquote>
<p>SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_12_0.html">version 3.12.0</a> is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
   A notable change in this release is an
   <a href="pgszchng2016.html">increase in the default page size</a> for newly created database files.
   There are also various performance improvements.
   See the <a href="releaselog/3_12_0.html">change log</a> for details.

   new <a href="fts5.html">FTS5</a> extension and increases a default setting in the <a href="spellfix1.html">spellfix1</a>
   extension, and implements enhancements to some of the Windows makefiles.

<p>Yikes!  An optimization attempt gone bad resulted in a 
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/80369eddd5c94">bug in the LIKE operator</a>
which is fixed by this patch release.
Three other minor but low-risk fixes are also included in the patch.

fix for the query planner bug
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/cb3aa0641d9a4">cb3aa0641d9a4</a> discovered by
Mapscape.  Also included is a minor API enhancement requested by

<p>SQLite version 3.8.11.1 is a patch release that fixes two arcane

<p>Yikes!  Index corruption after a sequence of valid SQL statements!
<p>It has been many years since anything like 
   <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/34cd55d6">this bug</a> has snuck into
   an official SQLite release.  But for the pasts seven months
   (<a href="releaselog/3_8_7.html">version 3.8.7</a> through <a href="releaselog/3_8_10_1.html">version 3.8.10.1</a>)
   if you do an INSERT into a carefully
   crafted schema in which there are two nested triggers that convert
   an index key value from TEXT to INTEGER and then back
   to TEXT again, the INTEGER value might get inserted as the index
   key instead of the correct TEXT, resulting in index corruption.
   This patch release adds a single line of code to fix the problem.
<p>If you do actually encounter this problem, running <a href="lang_reindex.html">REINDEX</a> on the
   damaged indexes will clear it.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2015_05_09"></a><h3>2015-05-09 - Release 3.8.10.1</h3><blockquote>
<p>The 3.8.10 release did not add the new <a href="compile.html#enable_dbstat_vtab">SQLITE_ENABLE_DBSTAT_VTAB</a>
   compile-time option to the <a href="c3ref/compileoption_get.html">sqlite3_compileoption_used()</a> interface.
   This patch release fixes that omission.  And while we are at it,
   the associated <a href="dbstat.html">dbstat virtual table</a> was enhanced slightly and a
   harmless compiler warning was fixed.</p>

<p>   <p>There is no reason to upgrade from version 3.8.10 unless you are
   using the new <a href="compile.html#enable_dbstat_vtab">SQLITE_ENABLE_DBSTAT_VTAB</a> compile-time option.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2015_05_07"></a><h3>2015-05-07 - Release 3.8.10</h3><blockquote>
<p>SQLite version 3.8.10 is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
   This release features performance improvements, fixes to several
   arcane bugs found by the AFL fuzzer, the new "sqldiff.exe" command-line
   utility, improvements to the documentation, and other enhancements.
   See the <a href='releaselog/3_8_10.html'>release notes</a> for 
   additional information.

<p>SQLite version 3.8.9 is a regularly scheduled maintenance release.
   New features in this release include the 
   <a href="pragma.html#pragma_index_xinfo">PRAGMA index_xinfo</a> command, the <a href="c3ref/status.html">sqlite3_status64()</a> interface,
   and the ".dbinfo" command of the <a href="cli.html">command-line shell</a>.
   See the <a href='releaselog/3_8_9.html'>release notes</a> for
   additional information.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2015_02_25"></a><h3>2015-02-25 - Release 3.8.8.3</h3><blockquote>
<p>The 3.8.8.3 patch release fixes an obscure problem in the SQLite code
   generator that can cause incorrect results when the qualifying expression
   of a <a href="partialindex.html">partial index</a> is used inside the ON clause of a LEFT JOIN.
   This problem has been in the code since support for partial indexes
   was first added in version 3.8.0.  However, it is difficult to imagine
   a valid reason to every put the qualifying constraint inside the ON
   clause of a LEFT JOIN, and so this issue has never come up before.</p>

<p><p>Any applications that is vulnerable to this bug would have encountered
   problems already.  Hence, upgrading from the previous release is optional.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2015_01_30"></a><h3>2015-01-30 - Release 3.8.8.2</h3><blockquote>
<p>The 3.8.8.2 patch release fixes a single minor problem:  It ensures
   that the <a href="c3ref/wal_checkpoint.html">sqlite3_wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)</a> operation will always truncate
   the <a href="wal.html">write-ahead log</a> even if log had already been reset and contained
   no new content.  It is unclear if this is a bug fix or a new feature.</p>

<p><p>Something like this would normally go into the next regularly scheduled
   release, but a prominent SQLite user needed the change in a hurry so
   we were happy to rush it out via this patch.</p>

<p><p>There is no reason to upgrade unless you actually need the enhanced
   behavior of <a href="c3ref/wal_checkpoint.html">sqlite3_wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)</a>.
</blockquote><hr width="50%"><a name="2015_01_20"></a><h3>2015-01-20 - Release 3.8.8.1</h3><blockquote>
<p>Within hours of releasing version 3.8.8, a bug was reported against
   the 10-month-old 3.8.4 release.  As that bug exists in all subsequent
   releases, the decision was made to issue a small patch to the
   3.8.8 before it came into widespread use.</p>

<p>SQLite <a href="releaselog/3_8_8.html">version 3.8.8</a> is a regularly schedule maintenance release of

<p><p>There are no dramatic new features or performance enhancements in this
